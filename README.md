# Machine Learning Model Training Projects

Welcome to this repository, which contains two machine learning projects demonstrating model training for **supervised learning** tasks:
1. **Classification** (Titanic Survival Prediction)
2. **Regression** (Calories Burnt Prediction)

## üöÄ Projects Overview

### **Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction** üõ≥Ô∏è [here is the app link](https://titanic-aryx.streamlit.app/)
- **Objective**: Predict passenger survivability on the Titanic using machine learning.
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Type**: Supervised Classification
- **Dataset**: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

#### **Steps Involved**:
1. Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training using **Logistic Regression**
4. Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score

üìå **Key Outcome**: A classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived based on available features.

# Mental Health Classification using Bi-LSTM [Click Here to test](https://mentalhealth-aryx.streamlit.app/)

This project aims to classify mental health conditions into five categories: **Depression**, **Anxiety**, **Stress**, **Bipolar Disorder**, and **Personality Disorder** using a **Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** model. The model is trained on a **Reddit text dataset** sourced from Kaggle, and the project leverages techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to preprocess and classify text data.

## Features

- **Bi-LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes the power of Bi-directional LSTM to capture both forward and backward contexts of text for improved accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and label encoding to clean and prepare text data for the model.
- **Classification Performance**: Achieved a test accuracy of **73%**, demonstrating the effectiveness of Bi-LSTM in text classification tasks.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a simple user interface to interact with the model and classify mental health conditions.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Reddit text dataset from Kaggle.
- **Categories**: The dataset contains text data labeled with five mental health conditions: **Depression**, **Anxiety**, **Stress**, **Bipolar Disorder**, and **Personality Disorder**.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Model Architecture**: Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
- **NLP Techniques**: Tokenization, Stop-word Removal, Label Encoding
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Reddit Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelghoshal/reddit-mental-health-data)
